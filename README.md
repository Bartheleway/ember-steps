**WARNING:** API and feature set is subject to change prior to `v1.0.0`.  Make sure to pay attention to changes between minor releases!

## Features

- Provides an extremely generic way of describing a series of views that should be shown in succession
- Provides absolutely CSS styling and the bare minimum HTML to stay out of the way of your code

## Installation

```bash
ember install ember-steps
```

## Basic Usage

Using `ember-steps` starts with creating a `step-manager`

```handlebars
{{#step-manager as |w|}}
  We'll put some cool stuff in here in a moment
{{/step-manager}}
```

Cool, right?  Ehh, it doesn't do much yet -- we need to add some steps

```handlebars
{{#step-manager as |w|}}
  {{#w.step name='a'}}
    This is the first step!
  {{/w.step}}

  {{#w.step name='b'}}
    This is the second step!
  {{/w.step}}
{{/step-manager}}
```

As you may have guessed, the first `w.step` component, `a`, will be visible initially, and `b` will be invisible.  Note that these names are important.  Why?  Because we need a way to transition between them!

```handlebars
{{#step-manager as |w|}}
  {{#w.step name='a'}}
    This is the first step!

    <button {{action w.transition-to 'b'}}>
      Next, please!
    </button>
  {{/w.step}}

  {{#w.step name='b'}}
    This is the second step!

    <button {{action w.transition-to 'a'}}>
      Wait, go back!
    </button>
  {{/w.step}}
{{/step-manager}}
```

The `step-manager` provides a [closure action][ember-closure-actions] that can be called with the name of a step to show that one, instead.  One of the neat features of `ember-steps` is that there is no explicit order to the steps; show all of them, or only some. It's entirely up to you.

## Not-So-Basic Usage

The above examples show the basic idea, but there's more configuration (and power) available if you need it.  Head over to [the wiki][wiki] to read more about what `ember-steps` can do!

## Compatibility Note

This addon uses the [hash helper][hash-helper], so Ember 2.3.0+ is required.
